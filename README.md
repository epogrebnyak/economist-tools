# Dataset clients 

These tools I developed help download and 
transform several useful country and corporate datasets.

- [weo](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/weo-reader) - IMF World Economic Outlook python client
- [boo](https://github.com/ru-corporate/boo) - Rosstat annual corporate reports 

This list is to be extended - I will add `comtrade`, `kep` and maybe others. 
Please also [send in](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/#about) your own similar projects.

# Learning

I alsо maintain several learning resources:

- [trics.me](https://trics.me) - an econometrics and statistics navigator
- [superhero](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/superhero) - business analyst-to-developper learning curriculum (in Russian)
- [haskell-intro](http://tinyurl.com/haskell-intro) - a guide into functional programming

# Replication

A placeholder for tools and best practice for replication and reproducibility in economics and social sciences. I worked on some improvements for [manubot](https://manubot.org) and [handout](https://github.com/danijar/handout) and got impressions to share.
