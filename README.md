# Dataset clients 

These tools I developed help download and 
transform several useful country and corporate datasets.

- [weo](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/weo-reader) - IMF World Economic Outlook python client
- [boo](https://github.com/ru-corporate/boo) - Rosstat annual corporate reports 
- [comtrade](https://github.com/ru-corporate/comtrade) - utilities to query UN Comtrade database

# Learning

I als–æ maintain several learning resources:

- [superhero](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/superhero) - business analyst-to-developper learning curriculum (in Russian)
- [haskell-intro](http://tinyurl.com/haskell-intro) - a guide into functional programming

# Replication

A placeholder for tools and best practice for replication and reproducibility in economics and social sciences. I worked on some improvements for [manubot](https://manubot.org) and [handout](https://github.com/danijar/handout) and got impressions to share.
