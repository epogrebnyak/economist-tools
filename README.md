# Dataset access and management

These tools I developed allow access to useful country and corporate datasets. 

- [weo](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/weo-reader) - IMF World Economic Outlook python client (`pip install weo`)
- [boo](https://github.com/ru-corporate/boo) - Rosstat annual corporate reports (`pip install boo`)
- [comtrade](https://github.com/ru-corporate/comtrade) - utilities to query UN Comtrade database for goods export

You can migrate parts of your data analysis from Excel to R/pandas using these packages and scripts or make subsets of data and work on them in Excel.

# Reference and learning

I als–æ maintain several learning resources:

- [trics.me](https://trics.me) - an econometrics and statistics navigator
- [superhero](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/superhero) - business analyst-to-developper learning curriculum (in Russian)
- [haskell-intro](http://tinyurl.com/haskell-intro) - a starter guide into functional programming with Haskell
- [learn/python](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/learn/blob/master/python.md) - top 3 resources I recommend as quick intro to python

# Replication and reproducibility

Economic analysis is not terribly advanced in replication and reproducibility. Required skills taught in fragments and there are powerful incentives to keep your work to yourself, but hope things are changing (open access publishing, literate programming, data APIs, etc.).

I contributed some code to the following open source tools:

- [manubot](https://manubot.org) - changes to citation management submodule
- [handout](https://github.com/danijar/handout) - minor fixes
