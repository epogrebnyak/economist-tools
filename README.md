# Dataset clients 

Here I tell about the data tools I developed. They help downloading and 
transforming datasets of country and corporate statistics.

- [weo](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/weo-reader)
- [boo](https://github.com/ru-corporate/boo)

This list is to be extended - I will add `comtrade`, `kep` and maybe others. 
Please also send in your own similar projects.
