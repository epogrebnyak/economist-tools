# Dataset access and management

These tools I developed allow access to useful country and corporate datasets. 

- [weo](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/weo-reader) - IMF World Economic Outlook python client
- [boo](https://github.com/ru-corporate/boo) - Rosstat annual corporate reports 
- [comtrade](https://github.com/ru-corporate/comtrade) - utilities to query UN Comtrade database for goods export

You can migrate parts of your data analysis from Excel to R/pandas using these packages or make subsets of data and work on them in Excel.

Please [send in](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/#about) your own similar projects for listing.

# Reference and learning

I als–æ maintain several learning resources:

- [trics.me](https://trics.me) - an econometrics and statistics navigator
- [superhero](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/superhero) - business analyst-to-developper learning curriculum (in Russian)
- [haskell-intro](http://tinyurl.com/haskell-intro) - a starter guide into functional programming with Haskell

# Replication and reproducibility

Economic analysis is not terribly advanced in replication and reproducibility. It is taught in fragments and there are internal incentive to keep your work to yours, but things are changing.

I contributed some code to the following open source tools:

- [manubot](https://manubot.org) - changes to citation management submodule
- [handout](https://github.com/danijar/handout) - minor fixes
